			<p>If ever there was an overcrowded field in play, it belongs to the compact SUV. The 2016 Honda CR-V is but one of many players here, doing battle with such stalwart competitors as the Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape and Chevrolet Equinox, as well as newer competitors such as the Hyundai Tucson and Jeep Cherokee. While each has its own merits, Honda’s 2016 CR-V seems to excel in every area that means the most to compact- crossover SUV consumers. Detractors will rightly point out that, unlike the Subaru Forester, the CR-V can’t really go off-road, and that cutting-edge safety features are only offered on the most expensive trims. But consumers don’t seem to mind these slights, and record sales numbers year after year appear to confirm it.</p>

			<h4>You'll Like This Car If...</h4>
			<p>Whether you’re just starting a family or finishing up with one, the 2016 Honda CR-V makes a great choice. Available all-wheel drive (AWD) is perfect for traveling in snow, and you’ll find little to complain about in the areas of fuel economy, reliability and resale figures.</p>

			<h4>You May Not Like This Car If...</h4>
			<p>If image is as important as ability, the CR-V may not shine. The Jeep Cherokee offers cool features like a panoramic moonroof and true off-road ability, while the Hyundai Santa Fe is a stylish challenger offering more luxury and tech. Need a 3rd-row seat? Nissan’s Rogue is the solution.</p>

			<h4>What's New for 2016</h4>
			<p>After a major makeover last year, changes to the 2016 Honda CR-V compact-crossover SUV are limited to a new SE trim. Positioned above the LX, the SE features 17-inch alloy wheels, a 2-tone finish, rear privacy glass and a security system.</p>

			<h3>Driving It</h3>
			<h4>Driving Impressions</h4>
			<p>If when you think “compact SUV” what comes to mind is a basic utility vehicle used for hauling gardening tools and screaming kids, the 2016 Honda CR-V crossover SUV will come as a revelation. The driving experience in a CR-V feels very car-like, with a smooth ride, precise handling and a cabin that isolates wind and road noise with surprising efficiency. Over smooth surfaces, the CR-V naturally feels calm and controlled, but even when the road gets dicey, Honda’s little people-mover remains unflappable. In corners, the CR-V exhibits minimal lean, and the steering’s excellent feedback allows for confident high-speed maneuvers. At the heart of the CR-V is a 2.4-liter engine with 185 horsepower on tap. With the help of a very capable CVT automatic, the CR-V can accelerate briskly, even with four people on board. Good fuel economy is also along for the ride, as is available Real Time AWD.</p>

			<h3>Favorite Features</h3>
			<h4>DIRECT-INJECTED 2.4-LITER ENGINE AND CVT</h4>
			<p>Honda’s 2016 CR-V SUV features a 2.4-liter direct-injection engine teamed with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Together, they help the CR-V return near class-leading fuel economy, as well as robust acceleration. It’s one of the best CVTs we’ve tested.</p>

			<h4>TOURING TRIM LEVEL</h4>
			<p>Although it costs the most, in this case the Touring trim is actually worth every penny. Along with its long list of luxury and in-car entertainment equipment, the Touring trim includes the Honda Sensing system that brings collision avoidance, adaptive cruise control and lane-departure warning, among other features.</p>
